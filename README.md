# Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL

Introduction to Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL
In this project, we utilize SQL to analyze pizza sales data, uncover trends, and derive insights that can enhance business decision-making. By leveraging SQL queries, we extract valuable information such as total revenue, top-selling pizzas, peak order times, and customer purchase behavior.

The analysis consists of three levels:

Basic Queries: These retrieve fundamental metrics like total orders, revenue, and the most popular pizzas.

Intermediate Queries: We join tables to explore deeper insights, such as category-wise distributions and revenue trends over time.

Advanced Queries: These include percentage contributions to total revenue and cumulative revenue analysis, providing strategic business insights.

Through this structured approach, we gain a comprehensive understanding of pizza sales, helping businesses optimize their pricing, menu, and customer engagement strategies. üìäüçï
